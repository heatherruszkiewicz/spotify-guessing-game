the aim of this project is to expand my knowledge of full-stack web development by creating an application that accesses a user's spotify charts and guess their data. 

currently the technologies i've used are:
- expressJS
- html
- css

resources currently used are:
- [the spotify docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/)

all non-original code will have it's source linked in the top of the document
